            <p class="page-text">I have an insatiable desire to impact lives in a positive manner through my passion for computer science and digital media, which developed from teaching my high school's computer programming class during my 11th and 12th grade years. I am pursuing a degree in Computational Media with a concentration in UI/UX Design. My goal is to become a UI/UX Designer in a role that allows me to combine my technical and creative skills to solve the most pressing problems in modern technology.</p>
